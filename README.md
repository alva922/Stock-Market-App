Plotly Dash Technical Analysis Stock Market App
We deploy a Plotly Dash stock market app [1] in Python using the dashboard [2] of user-defined stock prices with popularÂ technical indicators available in TA.
We download the live stock price via Yahoo Finance [3].
The entire workflow consists of the following 5 steps:

Step 1: Select a stock ticker symbol (NVDA) and retrieve stock data frame (df) from yfinance API at an interval of 1m

Step 2: Add Moving Averages (5day and 20day) to df and plot live share price

Step 3: Add Volume, MACD, and Stochastic Oscillator from TA

Step 4: Save our stock chart in HTML form, which means all the interactive features will be retained in the graph

Step 5: Implement the Plotly Dash app containing live NVDA stock prices with MA 5-15-50-200, Volume, RSI, and MACD.
